            <h2>SEU Alumni Team</h2>
            <p class="">
              Reading an alumni group should be fun, not a chore! By assembling a team of volunteers to manage the group, you can share responsibilities, make new friends, generate diverse ideas and support one another as a team. Having a group of involved alumni also helps with leadership continuity â€“ in case a leader moves or is unable to continue volunteering, other alumni are available to step in on an interim basis to continue group activities.
              
              Because of the number and variety of events that the groups are expected to host, it is necessary that alumni chapters and societies have at least a four-person leadership team. Suggested leadership team positions are chair, vice chair (chair-elect) and communications. The fourth position should be selected by the group. A list of suggestions is included below.
